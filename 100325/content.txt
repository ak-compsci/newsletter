Cybersecurity Awareness Month - Building a Cyber Strong America
October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month! For more than 20 years we have spotlighted the importance of taking daily action to reduce risks when online and using connected devices. This year, we focus on the government entities and small and medium businesses that are vital to protecting the systems and services that sustain us every day and make America a great place to live and do business: the nation’s critical infrastructure.  Much of the nation’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as well as private companies. Additionally, vendors, suppliers, and other parts of the supply chain that support or are connected to critical infrastructure play a critical cybersecurity role. 
Led by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

Alaska Feature
Digital Dojang: Breaking History in Computer Science

This month, the Songahm Academic Program in the Southeast Island School District launched a Digital Dojang — a classroom space modeled after Taekwondo sparring. Students train resilience, self-control, and indomitable spirit while applying these skills to technology.

	•	 Built an AI-powered computer from the ground up.
	•	 Explored drones, coding, and PC building through hands-on sparring rounds.
	•	 Used the SeeStories framework to connect digital learning with storytelling and community.
	•	 Made history by integrating Taekwondo philosophy into a U.S. public school setting for the first time.

The Digital Dojang is where culture and computer science meet, empowering students to grow in both technology and character.
For more information about this project contact Matthew Gore (magore@sisd.org) or visit the Songahm Academic Program at sisd.org
