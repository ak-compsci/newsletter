            <!-- Kids Still Need to Learn to Code -->
            <div style="font-weight:normal;padding:16px 24px 16px 24px">
              <h3>Why Kids Still Need to Learn to Code in the AI Era</h3>
              <p>
                Despite headlines about declining entry-level tech jobs, learning to code remains essential for young people. As Tarika Barrett, CEO of Girls Who Code, argues in <em>TIME Magazine</em>, when we discourage students from learning computer science, we limit their agency in a world where tech literacy is increasingly essential across all industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                The article highlights how the rise of AI has created a generation gap. Young people are told AI is the future, but they're excluded from the rooms where it's being created and used. We need youth voices to shape how fair, ethical, and useful AI will be.
              </p>
              <p>
                Computer science education develops more than coding skills. It builds computational and critical thinking capabilities that help students build confidence and trust their voices. We must advocate for young people to have opportunities to learn the skills and build the tools they need to solve today's problems and prepare for tomorrow's jobs.
